# Python-3.12.6-Calc-Open

## Overview
The `calc.py` file contains a basic math calculator implemented as a class. It provides functions for performing basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

This calculator is designed to be simple and easy to use, suitable for educational purposes or quick calculations. The main file is located in the function folder, and it can be utilized by importing it into your projects.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.
- **Defensive Programming**: The implementation includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and unexpected errors.
- **Flexible Usage**: Use the individual methods for straightforward operations, or utilize the `calculate` method for more complex calculations.

### Calculator Structure
- **Primary Methods**: 
  - `add(num1, num2)`: Adds two numbers.
  - `subtract(num1, num2)`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - `multiply(num1, num2)`: Multiplies two numbers.
  - `divide(num1, num2)`: Divides the first number by the second (with error handling for division by zero).

- **Secondary Method**:
  - `calculate(num1, num2, operation)`: A more flexible method for performing operations based on a string input representing the operation type.

## Usage
You can access the `usage` folder to see a working sample of how to use the calculator. This sample demonstrates the various operations supported by the `calc.py` file.

In future updates, we plan to further enhance the functionality by integrating a user-friendly interface.

## Future Development
In future updates, we will make a class for easier access and interaction with the calculator's features.
