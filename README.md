# Python-3.12.6-Calc-Open

## Description
The main file for this calculator project is `calc.py`, located in the function folder. This file contains all the essential functions for performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Functionality
- **Basic Operations**: 
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero

## Future Plans
In future updates, we plan to refactor the current structure into a class-based format. This change will provide:
- **Easier Access**: Users will be able to create instances of the calculator class, making the interface more intuitive.
- **Enhanced Features**: Additional functionalities can be easily added as methods to the class.

## Note
This calculator is designed with beginners in mind. It is not limited to juniors or those who might not want to create their own calculator from scratch. It serves as a helpful tool for anyone looking for a straightforward way to perform basic calculations.

## Accessing the Project
You can find the `usage` folder in your CALC folder, which contains working samples to help you understand how to use the calculator effectively.

## Usage
To use the calculator, run the `calc.py` file with Python 3.12.6:

```bash
